- **Project Summary**: 
  - **Background & Motivation**:
AI has already been widely used in deciding investments. However, not many previous studies have considered the transaction cost in the US stock market, which cannot verify its earning ability in the real world.
  - **Research Questions**:
The portfolio constructed by which combination of the machine learning method and portfolio optimization model will have the highest net profit.
  - **Application Scenario(Data Source)**: 
The study will choose a portfolio of 10 stocks. All the stock price data in the study will come from Yahoo Finance. The open price (O) and close price (C) will be used.  
Previous studies (Hernández-Nieves et al. 2020) (Peng and Linetsky 2022) have used prediction results in portfolio optimization, and Abel et. al.’s (2013) study has included the transaction cost in their trade execution. Based on these studies, we combine the two parts and widen its machine learning choice. At last, our study can also provide a direction for algorithm improvement.
  - **Methodology**: 
First, we will use two machine learning models, i.e., random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR), three deep learning models, i.e., LSTM neural network, deep multilayer perceptron (DMLP), and convolutional neural network (CNN), and one benchmark, i.e., autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to predict the return of investment (ROI) based on the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) of historical ROI. (Ma, Han, and Wang 2021)
Moreover, based on the former predictive results, we will input the data into mean-variance for forecasting (MVF) and omega for forecasting (OF) portfolio optimization models to construct the portfolio. (Ma, Han, and Wang 2021)
At last, considering the trade execution in the US stock market, we will deduct the transaction cost and work out the net profits. Then, we can compare the net profit of all the portfolios and find out which combination performs the best.

  - **Expected Results**: 
According to the previous results and implementation in the China securities 100 indexes, Random Forests machine learbning alogorithm combines with mean-variance for forecasting portfolio optimization model may still outperform othercombinations in the US stock market.

  - **Intellectual Merit & Practical Impacts**: 
The project will contribute to the application of machine learning methods in investment, and tell which algorithm can construct a better portfolio based on the prediction results. The study considers trade execution, taking transaction cost into account, and thus it can provide a direction for the improvement of the algorithms in a real-world implementation. Also, based on the results, it can provide a direction for improving the machine learning algorithms.

Figure No.2. The Confusion Matrix for Random Forest Classifier

**Figure No.2. source: [Yahoo Finance, Alphabet Inc.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL/history?p=GOOGL), created by [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)**

Figure No.2 is the confusion matrix of [Ridge Classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ridge-regression-and-classification) algorithm for GOOGL's return of investment (ROI) prediction using historical ROI data. The confusion matrix evaluates the performance of the classification algorithm. In this matrix, the X-axis is the predicted label and the Y-axis is the true label, in which 0 implies negative ROI while 1 indicates the ROI is nonnegative. From the left to the right, from the top to the bottom are TP, FP, FN, and TN respectively. In the model, the accuracy is (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN) = 361/ 749= 0.48, the recall is TP/(TP + FN) = 182/361 = 0.50, and the precision is TP/(TP + FP) = 182/357 = 0.51

Figure No.3. Histogram of Prediction Value y under Random Forest Regression

**Figure No.3. source: [Yahoo Finance, Alphabet Inc.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL/history?p=GOOGL), created by [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)**

Figure No.3 is the histogram of prediction value and true value using the algorithm Random Forest Regression. We are using the historical return of investment (ROI) data of GOOGL to predict the GOOGL ROI. The x-axis represents the ROI and the y-axis represents the number of data under each ROI. The more area the true value and the prediction value duplicates, the more accurate the prediction is. Under this algorithm, some area of true and the prediction duplicates together while the area is not large, showing that the predictive result is not very close to the true value. Meanwhile, the r2 score is -0.21, which is the closer to 1, the two variables are more related, showing the two values are not strongly correlated.

- **Final reflections**

First, we need to figure out what we want to predict, the Y variable and we want to use what to predict, the X variable. Afterwards, we need to let the machine learning algorithm to learn from our train data, and then we can use the historical data X to predict Y. Second, it is the causal inference. The algorithms kearn from massive data, and thus these data and algorithms have become solid evidence for the existence of the causality between X and Y. At last, we always need visulization to show the results. With the figures, it gives us a clearer and more direct feeling of the social science problems.
